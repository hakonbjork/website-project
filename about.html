          <p>
            The Martian crew consists of 20 staff members who are happy to help
            whenever necessary. We have a lot of experience with no-air customer
            service. The resort consists of a total of three different
            activities to participate in, along with a nice restaurant with some
            delicious food. We believe that the atmosphere at Mars creates a
            unique experience for a family, group of friends, and solo
            travelers. If you still miss your home planet, we provide “Earth
            rooms” with artificial plants and birds, to make home seem a little
            closer.

        <h1 class="article-header">Our History</h1>
        <p>
          The idea of a resort at Mars first appeared in the mind of the famous
          space traveler Flynn Liardet on a mission to the planet in 2024. Along
          with fellow astronauts and scientists, he began experiments with fully
          breathable areas and environments on the planet. A big breakthrough
          came in 2027, where five of the scientists were able to live, cook,
          and do daily chores at Mars in over a week. The project received
          government funding, and a lot of media coverage. In 2032, the first
          travelers could pay for a maximum a week at the resort. At that time,
          it was more expensive, and the journey was longer. Over the years,
          space technology improved. The resort became more affordable, and
          included several activities, as well as more rooms and possibilities
          for longer stays. Eventually, it transitioned into the resort as we
          know it today.
